# About

Ok, this project is an attempt to create a web application that offers a forecasting system for Euro 2012 football competition.
My main motivation is to learn the Scala language and the Play 2.0 framework as well as HTML5 and other 'trendy' libs/frameworks (Bootstrap, LESS, ...)
I would be surprised if this app ends up in a production environment for real use, but who knows ...
